            Sound Design by Alana Cronin (2022)
            <br>Visuals by Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot (2012) 
            <br><br> 
            Mixed in Reaper, breathing/dialogue voiced and recorded by me, some sound effects sourced from Soundsnap and Freesound and reworked in Audacity. Soundtracks sourced from Freesound.
            <br><br>
            This absolutely stunning animated short by Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot is a crimson and bloody rendition of the popular fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. Unlike the original European tale, this version of Little Red Riding Hood is certainly not child-friendly.
            <br><br>
            Opening with a silhouetted figure (the young heroine) skipping through a green forest, the clip soon shows she’s being stalked by the big bad wolf. Instead of the ensuing game of “my what big teeth you have,” Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot have the two engage in an epic, gladiator-esque duel.

            This video was created with AI based on the soundscape I created. My soundtrack is meant to be angelic but also haunting, giving a sense of the holy or sacred, but also an eerie and discomforting ambience. The combination of the ethereal and unsettling sounds creates a sense of wonder and fear, as though the viewer has stumbled upon a realm that is both enchanting and profoundly alien.

            This was made with the word ‘Sublime’ in mind. I wanted to create a calming soundscape that transport listeners to a tranquil oasis. Most sound effects sourced from Freesound, piano composed by me. Mixed in Reaper.
